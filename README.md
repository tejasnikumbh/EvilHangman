evilhangman
===========

Compiling instructions.

Currently tested on Linux. [Ubuntu distro]

1. Download the evilhangman.cpp and dictionary.txt into one folder.
2. Evil Hangman has no other dependencies, so compiling it with 
      g++ evilhangman.cpp -o evilhangman 
   should compile and generate an executable object file.
3. Run the executable using ./evilhangman
4. You're good to go!
